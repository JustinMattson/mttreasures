Welcome to Volunteer...Please Help Me!

While participating in Rake-Up-Boise during the fall of 2019, my groups raked leaves from the yards of 
those in need.  Most often the person was elderly, often with a husband who had passed.  I noticed
in addition to the leaves, there were other things around the house that had fallen into a state of 
disrepair.  Being handy around my own house, I knew there were many things I could do, in a very short
time, to make this person's life just a little bit easier/better.

Fast forward to March 2020, unemployed, COVID shutting down businesses and employers worried about
countless uncertainties, I looked for places to volunteer - to expand my network and potentially gain 
employment, all the while helping others!  However, many of these organizations also were shutting down 
due to the health concerns of the pandemic.

The vision behind Please Help Me! was to create an application where those in need of assistance could
reach out to others within their community, or for those with the desire to volunteer could offer their
time/skills to help others.

This application used Vue.js with JS on the front-end with Node.js and MongoDB on the back-end and was 
completed by a team of three:
  Justin Mattson,
  Kevin Lane,
  Xander Rutledge

We utilized the following tools to aid in project management:
  Figma for initial concept/design aspects.
  Lucid Charts for database relationship outline.
  Trello for SCRUM project management/bug tracking/features.
  Auth0 for user validation to restrict/enable posting/editing/deleting from the database.
